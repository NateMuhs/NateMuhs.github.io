                    <p>I have a deep-rooted desire to advance my knowledge and experience in the realm of electronics 
                        and hardware engineering. During my education, I have participated in clubs, research, and 
                        projects to broaden my knowledge and experience in these goals. I strive to contribute to 
                        the advancement of current hardware by making it smaller, cheaper, and more efficient for 
                        the producer and consumer.

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>I am honored to have worked alongside Dr. Tehranipoor at WVU to further the understanding 
                            of the security risks of foreign-imported CPUs. During my research, I worked with the 
                            Riscure system to test CPUs against side-channel hardware attacks.

                        <h2>Learn</h2>
                        <p>As a full-time student, learning both inside and outside of the classroom is my top priority. 
                            My current interests beyond class have guided my choices in academic electives, coursework, 
                            and clubs toward computer hardware. My time spent in the West Virginia University chapter of 
                            the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is an exemplary example of my 
                            drive to learn outside the classroom. Through this club, I have had the opportunity to work 
                            on hands-on projects to build my experience, as well as network with other students in my major.

                            Technician for the Wherial Global Supply Chain Lab and am currently interning at NASA as a 
                            Threat Researcher. Refer to my resume for my current work experience.

                                on stored data. It was capable of performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication

                    <h2>Junior in Electrical Engineering at WVU</h2>
                    <p>I am originally from Lewisburg, West Virginia, where I spent my time running, kayaking on the river, and working at the local gym. 
                        I began my undergraduate degree in the fall of 2023 and quickly got involved. I ran for and was elected vice president of the 
                        Artificial Intelligence Club, and I became an undergraduate researcher in hardware security under Dr. Tehranipoor. My current 
                        interests lie in developing projects to further my knowledge in hardware engineering.
